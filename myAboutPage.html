        <h3 style="text-align:center; color:white;">WHO IS HUGO?</h3>
        <P style = "text-align:center; color :#7B7B7C">I am an immigrant from Lisbon, Portugal who came to America in the early 2000's. My mother worked very hard in minimum wage jobs and eventually became a CNA to put me through private school.
           I then started working Landscaping at 15 and soon after I got into cars and trying to express myself through repairing and modifying cars.
           To this day I work closely with cars on my free time. I now work with precision machining and drilling as a way to improve my skills in fabricating.
           My goal is to become able to repair, maintain and modify cars to any purpose. Not only mechanically but also technologically.
        </P>
        <h3 style="text-align:center; color:white;">WHAT DOES TECH MEAN TO ME?</h3>
        <p style ="text-align:center;  color :#7B7B7C">In less than a hundred years we have gone from clunky dial up computers that took up whole rooms to cutting edge watches and smartphones that can access the internet within seconds. The pace at which technology grows never ceases to amaze me and I believe tech is very important tool to master. In 20 years alone we have just been perfecting how devices communicate with each other. Whether that be hardware or software, whenever it comes to communication in technology you look at programmers as the translators.
             Becoming a capable software developer would mean I could use old and new technology to my advantage for whatever application. I have had previous experience in Engineering field through my vocational high school and soon after I graduated I decided to work as a mechanic. I cannot say it hasn't taught me a lot but I fear the back-breaking work will catch up to me sooner than I'd like to admit.
             I want to be able to work and not have to worry about lifting this, and pulling that, etc... At a certain point I feel as if I'm not contributing to something I'm passionate about. I want to be able to say I love my job and  I have seen the reviews and I have been recommended here by colleagues who have heard and said nothing but good things. 
             Especially considering my schedule is pretty packed and I am ecstatic that classes are fully online. 
             I see that many companies directly partner/sponsor this program and that shows that it can and will deliver on it's promises. I am not really a school-oriented person nor will I ever say I am, but I am willing to sit down and perform at 110% if it means I can make something of myself in the ever-growing field of technology.
